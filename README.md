# Angular components

This project showcases 2 separate components: 
  * Table with sorting and pagination features
  * Progress circle

Both features were designed with a focus on functionality and Angular best practices, while keeping a minimalist design.
There are areas that could be improved in a production ready version of the components. APIs were mocked in order to
maintain a strategy similar to a real application.

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 17.3.3.
